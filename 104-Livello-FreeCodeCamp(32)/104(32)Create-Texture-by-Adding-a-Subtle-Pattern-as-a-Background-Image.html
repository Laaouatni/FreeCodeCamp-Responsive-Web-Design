Create Texture by Adding a Subtle Pattern as a Background Image One way to add texture and interest to a background and have it stand out more is to add a subtle pattern. The key is balance, as you don't want the background to stand out too much, and
take away from the foreground. The background property supports the url() function in order to link to an image of the chosen texture or pattern. The link address is wrapped in quotes inside the parentheses. Using the url of https://cdn-media-1.freecodecamp.org/imgr/MJAkxbh.png,
set the background of the whole page with the body selector. -->
