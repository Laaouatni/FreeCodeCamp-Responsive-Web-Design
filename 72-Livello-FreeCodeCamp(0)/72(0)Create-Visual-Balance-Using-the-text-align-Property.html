<!-- Create Visual Balance Using the text-align Property This section of the curriculum focuses on Applied Visual Design. The first group of challenges build on the given card layout to show a number of core principles. Text is often a large part of web content.
CSS has several options for how to align it with the text-align property. text-align: justify; causes all lines of text except the last line to meet the left and right edges of the line box. text-align: center; centers the text text-align: right; right-aligns
the text And text-align: left; (the default) left-aligns the text. Align the h4 tag's text, which says "Google", to the center. Then justify the paragraph tag which contains information about how Google was founded. -->
