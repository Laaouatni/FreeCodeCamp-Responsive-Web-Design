<!-- Use the CSS Transform scale Property to Scale an Element on Hover The transform property has a variety of functions that let you scale, move, rotate, skew, etc., your elements. When used with pseudo-classes such as :hover that specify a certain state
of an element, the transform property can easily add interactivity to your elements. Here's an example to scale the paragraph elements to 2.1 times their original size when a user hovers over them: p:hover { transform: scale(2.1); } Note: Applying a transform
to a div element will also affect any child elements contained in the div. Add a CSS rule for the hover state of the div and use the transform property to scale the div element to 1.1 times its original size when a user hovers over it. -->
