<!-- Lock an Element to its Parent with Absolute Positioning The next option for the CSS position property is absolute, which locks the element in place relative to its parent container. Unlike the relative position, this removes the element from the normal
flow of the document, so surrounding items ignore it. The CSS offset properties (top or bottom and left or right) are used to adjust the position. One nuance with absolute positioning is that it will be locked relative to its closest positioned ancestor.
If you forget to add a position rule to the parent item, (this is typically done using position: relative;), the browser will keep looking up the chain and ultimately default to the body tag. Lock the #searchbar element to the top-right of its section
parent by declaring its position as absolute. Give it top and right offsets of 50 pixels each. -->
