<!-- 
Lock an Element to the Browser Window with Fixed Positioning The next layout scheme that CSS offers is the fixed position, which is a type of absolute positioning that locks an element relative to the browser window. Similar to absolute positioning, it's
used with the CSS offset properties and also removes the element from the normal flow of the document. Other items no longer "realize" where it is positioned, which may require some layout adjustments elsewhere. One key difference between the fixed and
absolute positions is that an element with a fixed position won't move when the user scrolls. The navigation bar in the code is labeled with an id of navbar. Change its position to fixed, and offset it 0 pixels from the top and 0 pixels from the left.
After you have added the code, scroll the preview window to see how the navigation stays in place. -->
