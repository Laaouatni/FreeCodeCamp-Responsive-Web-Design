<!-- Adjust the Tone of a Color The hsl() option in CSS also makes it easy to adjust the tone of a color. Mixing white with a pure hue creates a tint of that color, and adding black will make a shade. Alternatively, a tone is produced by adding gray or by
both tinting and shading. Recall that the 's' and 'l' of hsl() stand for saturation and lightness, respectively. The saturation percent changes the amount of gray and the lightness percent determines how much white or black is in the color. This is useful
when you have a base hue you like, but need different variations of it. All elements have a default background-color of transparent. Our nav element currently appears to have a cyan background, because the element behind it has a background-color set
to cyan. Add a background-color to the nav element so it uses the same cyan hue, but has 80% saturation and 25% lightness values to change its tone and shade. -->
