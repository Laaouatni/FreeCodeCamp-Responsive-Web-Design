<!-- Adjust the Hover State of an Anchor Tag This challenge will touch on the usage of pseudo-classes. A pseudo-class is a keyword that can be added to selectors, in order to select a specific state of the element. For example, the styling of an anchor tag
can be changed for its hover state using the :hover pseudo-class selector. Here's the CSS to change the color of the anchor tag to red during its hover state: a:hover { color: red; } The code editor has a CSS rule to style all a tags black. Add a rule
so that when the user hovers over the a tag, the color is blue. -->
