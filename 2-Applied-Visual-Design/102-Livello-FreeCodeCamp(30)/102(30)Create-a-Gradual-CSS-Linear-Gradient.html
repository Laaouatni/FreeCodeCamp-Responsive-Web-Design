<!-- 
Create a Gradual CSS Linear Gradient Applying a color on HTML elements is not limited to one flat hue. CSS provides the ability to use color transitions, otherwise known as gradients, on elements. This is accessed through the background property's linear-gradient()
function. Here is the general syntax: background: linear-gradient(gradient_direction, color 1, color 2, color 3, ...); The first argument specifies the direction from which color transition starts - it can be stated as a degree, where 90deg makes a horizontal
gradient (from left to right) and 45deg makes a diagonal gradient (from bottom left to top right). The following arguments specify the order of colors used in the gradient. Example: background: linear-gradient(90deg, red, yellow, rgb(204, 204, 255));
Use a linear-gradient() for the div element's background, and set it from a direction of 35 degrees to change the color from #CCFFFF to #FFCCCC. -->
