<!-- 
Adjust the Hue of a Color Colors have several characteristics including hue, saturation, and lightness. CSS3 introduced the hsl() property as an alternative way to pick a color by directly stating these characteristics. Hue is what people generally think
of as 'color'. If you picture a spectrum of colors starting with red on the left, moving through green in the middle, and blue on right, the hue is where a color fits along this line. In hsl(), hue uses a color wheel concept instead of the spectrum, where
the angle of the color on the circle is given as a value between 0 and 360. Saturation is the amount of gray in a color. A fully saturated color has no gray in it, and a minimally saturated color is almost completely gray. This is given as a percentage
with 100% being fully saturated. Lightness is the amount of white or black in a color. A percentage is given ranging from 0% (black) to 100% (white), where 50% is the normal color. Here are a few examples of using hsl() with fully-saturated, normal lightness
colors: Color HSL red hsl(0, 100%, 50%) yellow hsl(60, 100%, 50%) green hsl(120, 100%, 50%) cyan hsl(180, 100%, 50%) blue hsl(240, 100%, 50%) magenta hsl(300, 100%, 50%) Change the background-color of each div element based on the class names (green,
cyan, or blue) using hsl(). All three should have full saturation and normal lightness. -->

hue             -> tinta        -> tutti i colori  da   (0) a                          (255) 
, 
saturation      -> saturazione  -> da grigio            (0) a colore che ti interessa  (100)
, 
and lightness   -> luminositÃ    -> da nero              (0) a bianco                   (100), passando per il colore che interessa(50)
