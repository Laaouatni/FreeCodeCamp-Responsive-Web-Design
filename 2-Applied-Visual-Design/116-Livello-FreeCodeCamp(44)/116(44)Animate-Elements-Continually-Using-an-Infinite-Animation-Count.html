<!-- Animate Elements Continually Using an Infinite Animation Count The previous challenges covered how to use some of the animation properties and the @keyframes rule. Another animation property is the animation-iteration-count, which allows you to control
how many times you would like to loop through the animation. Here's an example: animation-iteration-count: 3; In this case the animation will stop after running 3 times, but it's possible to make the animation run continuously by setting that value to
infinite. To keep the ball bouncing on the right on a continuous loop, change the animation-iteration-count property to infinite. -->
