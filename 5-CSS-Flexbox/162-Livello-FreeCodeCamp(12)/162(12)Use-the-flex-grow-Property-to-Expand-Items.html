<!-- 
Use the flex-grow Property to Expand Items The opposite of flex-shrink is the flex-grow property. Recall that flex-shrink controls the size of the items when the container shrinks. The flex-grow property controls the size of items when the parent container
expands. Using a similar example from the last challenge, if one item has a flex-grow value of 1 and the other has a flex-grow value of 3, the one with the value of 3 will grow three times as much as the other. Add the CSS property flex-grow to both #box-1
and #box-2. Give #box-1 a value of 1 and #box-2 a value of 2. -->
