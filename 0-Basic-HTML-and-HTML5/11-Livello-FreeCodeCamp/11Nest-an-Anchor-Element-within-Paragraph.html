<!-- Nest an Anchor Element within a Paragraph You can nest links within other text elements.

<p>
    Here's a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.freecodecamp.org"> link to www.freecodecamp.org</a> for you to follow.
</p>
Let's break down the example. Normal text is wrapped in the p element:

<p> Here's a ... for you to follow. </p>
Next is the anchor element <a> (which requires a closing tag </a>):

<a> ... </a> target is an anchor tag attribute that specifies where to open the link. The value _blank specifies to open the link in a new tab. The href is an anchor tag attribute that contains the URL address of the link:

<a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org" target="_blank"> ... </a> The text, link to www.freecodecamp.org, within the a element is called anchor text, and will display the link to click:

<a href=" ... " target="...">link to freecodecamp.org</a> The final output of the example will look like this: Here's a link to www.freecodecamp.org for you to follow. Nest the existing a element within a new p element. Do not create a new anchor tag.
The new paragraph should have text that says View more cat photos, where cat photos is a link, and the rest is plain text. -->
