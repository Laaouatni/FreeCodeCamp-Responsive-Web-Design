<!-- Fill in the Blank with Placeholder Text Web developers traditionally use lorem ipsum text as placeholder text. The lorem ipsum text is randomly scraped from a famous passage by Cicero of Ancient Rome. Lorem ipsum text has been used as placeholder text
by typesetters since the 16th century, and this tradition continues on the web. Well, 5 centuries is long enough. Since we're building a CatPhotoApp, let's use something called "kitty ipsum" text. Replace the text inside your p element with the first
few words of this kitty ipsum text: Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff. -->
