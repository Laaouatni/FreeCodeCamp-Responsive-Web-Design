<!-- Know When Alt Text Should be Left Blank In the last challenge, you learned that including an alt attribute when using img tags is mandatory. However, sometimes images are grouped with a caption already describing them, or are used for decoration only.
In these cases, alt text may seem redundant or unnecessary. When an image is already explained with text content or does not add meaning to a page, the img still needs an alt attribute, but it can be set to an empty string. Here's an example:

<img src="visualDecoration.jpeg" alt=""> Background images usually fall under the 'decorative' label as well. However, they are typically applied with CSS rules, and therefore not part of the markup screen readers process. Note: For images with a caption,
you may still want to include alt text since it helps search engines catalog the image's content. Camper Cat has coded a skeleton page for the blog part of his website. He's planning to add a visual break between his two articles with a decorative image
of a samurai sword. Add an alt attribute to the img tag and set it to an empty string. (Note that the image src doesn't link to an actual file - don't worry that there are no swords showing in the display.) -->
