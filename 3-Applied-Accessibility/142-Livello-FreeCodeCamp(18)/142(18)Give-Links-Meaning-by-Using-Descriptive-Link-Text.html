<!-- Give Links Meaning by Using Descriptive Link Text Screen reader users have various options for what type of content their device reads. These options include skipping to (or over) landmark elements, jumping to the main content, or getting a page summary
from the headings. Another option is to only hear the links available on a page. Screen readers do this by reading the link text, or what's between the anchor (a) tags. Having a list of "click here" or "read more" links isn't helpful. Instead, use brief
but descriptive text within the a tags to provide more meaning for these users. The link text that Camper Cat is using is not very descriptive without the surrounding context. Move the anchor (a) tags so they wrap around the text information about batteries
instead of Click here. -->
