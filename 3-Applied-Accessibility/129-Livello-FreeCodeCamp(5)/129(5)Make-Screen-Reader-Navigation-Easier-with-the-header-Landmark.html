<!-- Make Screen Reader Navigation Easier with the header Landmark The next HTML5 element that adds semantic meaning and improves accessibility is the header tag. It's used to wrap introductory information or navigation links for its parent tag and works well
around content that's repeated at the top on multiple pages. header shares the embedded landmark feature you saw with main, allowing assistive technologies to quickly navigate to that content. Note: The header is meant for use in the body tag of your
HTML document. It is different than the head element, which contains the page's title, meta information, etc. Camper Cat is writing some great articles about ninja training, and wants to add a page for them to his site. Change the top div that currently
contains the h1 to a header tag instead. -->
