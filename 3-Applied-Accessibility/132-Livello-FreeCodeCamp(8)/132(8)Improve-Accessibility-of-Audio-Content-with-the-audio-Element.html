<!-- Improve Accessibility of Audio Content with the audio Element HTML5 's audio element gives semantic meaning when it wraps sound or audio stream content in your markup. Audio content also needs a text alternative to be accessible to people who are deaf
or hard of hearing. This can be done with nearby text on the page or a link to a transcript. The audio tag supports the controls attribute. This shows the browser default play, pause, and other controls, and supports keyboard functionality. This is a
boolean attribute, meaning it doesn't need a value, its presence on the tag turns the setting on. Here 's an example:

<audio id="meowClip" controls>
  <source src="audio/meow.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
  <source src="audio/meow.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
</audio> Note: Multimedia content usually has both visual and auditory components. It needs synchronized captions and a transcript so users with visual and/or auditory impairments can access it. Generally, a web developer is not responsible for creating
the captions or transcript, but needs to know to include them. Time to take a break from Camper Cat and meet fellow camper Zersiax (@zersiax), a champion of accessibility and a screen reader user. To hear a clip of his screen reader in action, add an
audio element after the p. Include the controls attribute. Then place a source tag inside the audio tags with the src attribute set to https://s3.amazonaws.com/freecodecamp/screen-reader.mp3 and type attribute set to "audio/mpeg". Note: The audio clip
may sound fast and be difficult to understand, but that is a normal speed for screen reader users. -->
