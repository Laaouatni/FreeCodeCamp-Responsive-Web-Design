        <h2>Machine Learning in the Kitchen</h2>
        <p>Join this two day workshop that walks through how to implement cutting-edge snack-getting algorithms with a command line interface. Coding usually involves writing exact instructions, but sometimes you need your computer to execute flexible commands,
            like <code>fetch Pringles</code>.</p>

Adjust the Color of Various Elements to Complementary Colors The Complementary Colors challenge showed that opposite colors on the color wheel can make each other appear more vibrant when placed side-by-side. However, the strong visual contrast can be
jarring if it's overused on a website, and can sometimes make text harder to read if it's placed on a complementary-colored background. In practice, one of the colors is usually dominant and the complement is used to bring visual attention to certain
content on the page. This page will use a shade of teal (#09A7A1) as the dominant color, and its orange (#FF790E) complement to visually highlight the sign-up buttons. Change the background-color of both the header and footer from black to the teal color.
Then change the h2 text color to teal as well. Finally, change the background-color of the button to the orange color. -->
