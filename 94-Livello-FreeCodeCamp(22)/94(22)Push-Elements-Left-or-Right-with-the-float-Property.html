<!-- 
Push Elements Left or Right with the float Property The next positioning tool does not actually use position, but sets the float property of an element. Floating elements are removed from the normal flow of a document and pushed to either the left or
right of their containing parent element. It's commonly used with the width property to specify how much horizontal space the floated element requires. The given markup would work well as a two-column layout, with the section and aside elements next to
each other. Give the #left item a float of left and the #right item a float of right. -->
