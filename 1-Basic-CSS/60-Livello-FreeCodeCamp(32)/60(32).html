Use Hex Code to Mix Colors To review, hex codes use 6 hexadecimal digits to represent colors, two each for red (R), green (G), and blue (B) components. From these three pure colors (red, green, and blue), we can vary the amounts of each to create over
16 million other colors! For example, orange is pure red, mixed with some green, and no blue. In hex code, this translates to being #FFA500. The digit 0 is the lowest number in hex code, and represents a complete absence of color. The digit F is the highest
number in hex code, and represents the maximum possible brightness. Replace the color words in our style element with their correct hex codes. Color Hex Code Dodger Blue #1E90FF Green #00FF00 Orange #FFA500 Red #FF0000 -->
