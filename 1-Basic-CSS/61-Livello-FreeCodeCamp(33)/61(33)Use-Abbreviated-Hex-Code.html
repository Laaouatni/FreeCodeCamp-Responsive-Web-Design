<!-- Use Abbreviated Hex Code Many people feel overwhelmed by the possibilities of more than 16 million colors. And it's difficult to remember hex code. Fortunately, you can shorten it. For example, red's hex code #FF0000 can be shortened to #F00. This shortened
form gives one digit for red, one digit for green, and one digit for blue. This reduces the total number of possible colors to around 4,000. But browsers will interpret #FF0000 and #F00 as exactly the same color. Go ahead, try using the abbreviated hex
codes to color the correct elements. Color Short Hex Code Cyan #0FF Green #0F0 Red #F00 Fuchsia #F0F -->
